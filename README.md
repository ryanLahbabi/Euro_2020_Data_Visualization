# Data Visualization EURO 2020


## 1. Introduction
The importance of soccer in the international landscape emanates from the great budget implications and the massive public attendance at its events, either physically or through the broadcasting of the matches. Today, the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) boasts more member countries than the United Nations, a testament to the extraordinary global proliferation of football. Indeed, for FIFA’s budget for the 2023-2026 cycle, the total budgeted estimated revenue is an unprecedented USD 11,000 million. Once a modest pastime, football has burgeoned into a worldwide phenomenon, captivating billions and establishing itself as the most popular sport on the planet.

This project focuses on the 2020 European Football Championship, the 16th edition of the European Championship organized by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA). The main objective is to compare the performance of some teams and their players with that of the tournament winner, Italy, to highlight the most impactful parameters on which a victory depends, thereby helping enhance the teams' performances.

## 2. Objective
The objective is to exploit the data pertaining to the match events, the match information, the player statistics, the match statistics, and the line-ups sheets in the database provided by the startup Sports AI to highlight the different metrics having impacted the performance of other teams compared to Italy, the tournament winner. The different parameters might include the common ones adopted in sports analyses, but also additional ones which might have escaped the notice of analysts and which might have weighed in the final performance.

We have chosen to compare the metrics of teams from different levels of closeness to victory, hence having experienced different tournament rounds, along with Italy: The England as a representative of the final, Spain for the semi-finals, Belgium for the quarter-finals, Austria for the round of 16, and Switzerland for the group stage. Likewise, associated players from those teams will have their data analyzed.

## 3. Targeted Public
The visualization is primarily designed for coaching purposes and for technical team staff seeking to pinpoint the limitations of their respective teams and learn from the tactics, performance, and progress of the winner (Italy) to gradually build success. The targeted application end-users will develop their future match management strategies and make informed decisions based on the knowledge and insights gained from these visualizations and their associated analyses. The resulting design application is easily accessible to the targeted public and interested audiences via a web browser on their computers. It can also be made available as a mobile app with a little design fit.

## 6. Technical Details
The user runs their Flask application from a file named server.py, not app.py.
The project includes various visualization techniques such as bracket charts, line-up charts, stacked-bar charts, radar charts, and violin plots.
Challenges faced include data complexity, technical limitations, user interface design, and time constraints.
